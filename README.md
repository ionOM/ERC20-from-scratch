To better understand how to create and how an erc-20 token works, I decided to create it from scratch without importing any library. This is a more time consuming process and less secure than already using the OpenZeppelin library.

My token has all the standards that an erc-20 must have, I also added the mint and burn function.

I deployed this contract on Goerli Testnet, this is the address of the contract: 0xD6F400fb2644441d56E1FB9eb1393DB4f74A025b.
